# @zazuko/cube-hierarchy-query

## 2.2.2

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

### Patch Changes

- b8fd9b7: Update `@zazuko/env` to `1.10.1`
- b8fd9b7: Update `@hydrofoil/shape-to-query` - allows extending `PropertyShape` (see [example/hierarchy.ts](example/hierarchy.ts))

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 573ccd8: The `query` object returned by `children` and `example` functions is now typed as `Describe` which has a slightly different signature from `Construct` which was returned previously. (note that the actual query has not changed)
- 573ccd8: The `getHierarchy` exported by the main module now generates a `CONSTRUCT` query which should yield a great improvement in performance in some cases (closes #17)

### Patch Changes

- 573ccd8: Removed dependency on `chai-snapshot-matcher` which should have been dev-only

## 1.0.2

  + const { children: childrenResult } = await children(...)
  ```

- 1d4ac7e: First version

### Minor Changes

- f946c50: Getting entire hierarchy. See example in `examples/hierarchy.ts`. Run it like
